SEE ALSO
        We also have a file backup assistant written in Perl:
        L<baker|https://github.com/jangcom/baker>
        The main difference between tilder and baker is
        the naming of subdirectories:
        - tilder (Python 3) ... subdirs are suffixed by the tilde (~)
        - baker (Perl 5)    ... subdirs are prefixed by 'bak_'
